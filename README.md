# Devops Containers

I've built this container in so many repos that I'm finally pushing it to a public repo. This container installs:

* tenv
* nvm
* packer
* aws cli
* sops

These are all the services I regularly used and should grow with time. This container is not meant to be deployed but instead for local developer only.

View the [source code repo](https://github.com/myoolala/devops-containers) for an example docker compose file on how to use the container

docker pull 5pmgrass/tenviac
